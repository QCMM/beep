A binding energy evaluation platform and database for molecules on interstellar ice-grain mantels.

If you would like to Query the platform using the BindingParadies class or QCPortal you 
will need to install the  QCPortal python module:

`conda install -c conda-forge qcportal`

If you would like to create your own database using the BEEP protocol or if you would like 
to contribute to the BEEP database you will need to install the QCFractal module. 

`conda install -c conda-forge qcfractal`

For examples of data query and data generation head to the tutorials folder in this repository.
