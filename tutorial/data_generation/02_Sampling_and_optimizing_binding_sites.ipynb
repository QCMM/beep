    "This tutorial will explain to you the procedure to compute a BE energy distribution on a amorphized set \n",
    "of water clusters. In the previous tutorial we learned how to create a OptimizationDatase. For this tutorial we assume that you already learned how to set up a [QCFractal server](http://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/projects/QCFractal/en/stable/setup_server.html) and spin up a [QCFractal manager](http://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/projects/QCFractal/en/stable/managers.html) on your server. The same instructions are valid if you want to contribute to the BEEP database, the only thing that changes is the URL of the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "So at this point you have already created a collection with a set of amporphised water clusters. We will use the set consisting of 12 water molecules constructed in the previous tutorial. You also have an OptimizationDataset which contains the optimized geometry of the small molecule you want to sample, for this example we will use methanol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total procedure consists of three steps, **sampling the water clusters**, **computing the BSSE corrected binding energy for each unique binding site** and **computing the Hessian** for the binding site of one of the sampled clusters to obtain a zero-point vibrational energy correction for the binding energy calculation. For each one of these three steps there is a dedicated CLI tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to sample the surface of the water clusters that span the model surface. With this purpose, `launch_sampling` creates two OptimizationDataSets:  One that contains initial sampled structures (with the prefix *pre*) and a second one where the unique optimized structures are stored after the initial optimization at the sampling level of theory. After the initial optimization is done, the geometry of the binding sites is refined using a HF-3C/MINIX level of theory. Nonetheless the geometries can also be further optimized (e.g. at a DFT hybrid or meta-hyrbid GGA level of theory) as they are contained in a Dataset. \n",
    "For the sampling procedure we developed a option-specific command line interface `launch_sampling.py`. It can be found in the scripts folder of this module. "
